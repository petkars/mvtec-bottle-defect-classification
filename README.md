## **Objective**

Your task is to develop a machine learning model to classify images of items/industrial equipment into two categories:

- **Defective**
- **Non-Defective**

### **Bonus Objectives (Optional)**

1. Identify and classify the specific types of defects in the defective images.
2. Optimize the model for hardware-accelerated inference (e.g., using GPU, TPU, NPU, FPGA, etc.).

---

## **What You'll Do**

### **1. Data Preparation**

- Select or create a dataset containing images of industrial equipment labeled as `defective` or `non-defective`.
- (Optional) For defective images, include additional labels for specific defect types.
- Preprocess the data (e.g., resizing, normalization, or augmentation, etc.)

---

### **2. Model Development**

- Train a machine learning model (e.g., a Convolutional Neural Network) to classify images into the two categories. You can use any or even multiple types of machine learning that you think fits this problem statement.
- (Optional) Extend the model to classify defect types.
- Ensure your code is modular and well-documented.

---

### **3. Model Evaluation**

- Evaluate the model using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**, or any other metric you deem necessary.
- Use a confusion matrix to analyze misclassifications.
- Document your findings and provide any insights gained from the analysis.

---

## **Deliverables**

1. **Source Code**  
   - Include your data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.
   - Ensure all dependencies are listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Project Report**  
   - A concise summary (`report.md` or `report.pdf`) describing:  
     - Your approach and methodology.  
     - Model performance and metrics.  
     - Insights or challenges faced.  
   - If you complete any of the bonus objectives, document them in your report and include the relevant code.

     git push origin main
     ```

3. **Final Submission**  
   - Push all your changes to the repository.
   - Ensure your `main` branch contains:
     - Your source code.
     - The project report.
     - Any other relevant files.
   - Verify everything is up-to-date by visiting your repository on GitHub.
